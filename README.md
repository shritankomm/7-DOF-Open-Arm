# 7-DOF Open Source 3D Printed Humanoid Arms

An open-source, fully 3D-printable 7-DOF humanoid robotic arm designed as an accessible research platform. Built with high-torque Feetech serial bus servos and a Raspberry Pi 5, it supports ROS2 for motion planning, VR teleoperation for intuitive control, and autonomous/agentic operation via an onboard camera. With all CAD files, BOM, and software fully open source, anyone can build and expand on it for under $1,000.

## Inspiration
- I made this project as something I find interest in is human-related robotics. In the past, I have made prosthetics and other medical devices, and this felt like the fun next step. I also built this as an act to make a low-cost research tool and as an ability for me to begin learning more advanced robotics. I'm exploring ROS and OpenCV and plan to integrate them. I'll document this journey and open-source it so others can follow and build upon the project, doing bigger and better things. I aim to inspire more human-centered robotics. I have plans for more humanoid robot projects (a pair of legs, for example) and will document them on GitHub and make them open source so everyone can learn.

## Features of the Finished Project

- 7 Degrees of Freedom - full human-like range of motion across the shoulder, elbow, and wrist
- High-torque serial bus servos - 30 kg at most joints, 50kg at the shoulder
- Fully 3D printable - all structural components printed in PETG at high infill, no custom machined parts required
- ROS2 integration - built for compatibility with the broader robotics software ecosystem
- VR teleoperation - control the arm intuitively through a VR headset
- Autonomous and agentic control - onboard Raspberry Pi 5 and camera enable independent perception and decision-making
- Under $1,000 - accessible to students, researchers, and makers without institutional budgets
