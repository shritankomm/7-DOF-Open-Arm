# 7-DOF Open Source 3D Printed Humanoid Arms

An open-source, fully 3D-printable 7-DOF humanoid robotic arm designed as an accessible research platform. Built with high-torque Feetech serial bus servos and a Raspberry Pi 5, it supports ROS2 for motion planning, VR teleoperation for intuitive control, and autonomous/agentic operation via an onboard camera. With all CAD files, BOM, and software fully open source, anyone can build and expand on it for under $1,000.

## Features

- 7 Degrees of Freedom - full human-like range of motion across the shoulder, elbow, and wrist
- High-torque serial bus servos - 30 kg at most joints, 50kg at the shoulder
- Fully 3D printable - all structural components printed in PETG at high infill, no custom machined parts required
- ROS2 integration - built for compatibility with the broader robotics software ecosystem
- VR teleoperation - control the arm intuitively through a VR headset
- Autonomous and agentic control - onboard Raspberry Pi 5 and camera enable independent perception and decision-making
- Under $1,000 - accessible to students, researchers, and makers without institutional budgets
